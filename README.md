<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A python script that turns strings and text files into morse code. It can also retake in it's morse output to give you back readable English. If you're not familiar with Morse code, [click](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) here.

Why? Well, no reason at all. I thought it would be cool to have a secret cypher converter like this in my back pocket in case I get chased down by the FBI and need to use encrypted messages. Sure, there are other more secure cyphers out there, but Morse code is just cool okay.

### Built With

Python3. That's it.
